The MATLAB and SIMULINK files in this folder can be used to simulate the behavior of the system. 


LPV_controller_Simulation_6DOF.slx: This SIMULINK file simulates the control loop.

- The pink box represents the nonlinear 6DOF model of the robot, that was identified in a previous project. It is ready to use.
- The blue box represents the LPV controller based on the affine LPV model with the 16 affine parameters theta.
- The uncommented blue box was intended to be for the LPV controller based on the approximate LPV model (phi parameters). It is not yet working.
- The simulation results can be seen in the green box. The results are saved to workspace (q_data_lpv).
- The reference signals to test the controller are generated by ramp-functions. During the project I used sigmoids based on the predictions of the ping pong ball.
